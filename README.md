## Notes
One of the biggest challenges was debugging a Git push issue related to incorrect user credentials. I also had to clear out cached credentials and reset my remote to push from the correct GitHub account. Additionally, ensuring all event handlers properly filtered the data and cleared the DOM before rendering new cards was key to smooth user interaction.
